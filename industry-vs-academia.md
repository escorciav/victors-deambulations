# Industry or Academia that's the question!

> When we push ourselves to greatness, we may end up believing that we are great.

As industry and academia in #AI have mixed, I have noticed that some (especially students) may ignore the big picture.

As former PhD student & now research scientist in indsutry, perhaps I have enough credentials to give one or two tips for the ladies & gents considering industry.

- Papers are just another KPI.

    BTW, a paper is just a cute badge (i.e., NOT the most important). A paper is equally valuable than a patent. Has you filed one easier to file ðŸ˜œ? Make your own conclusion.

- As a manager of mine said, "You don't need 5 papers per year!"

    Instead showing that you know something and that you are able to do it. So, how many papers do you need to get the seat?

- Don't be arrogant assuming that after a PhD/postdoc/Prof the company must give u unlimited budget to execute a research agenda.

    Prove it yourself!
- A company is a community (like your university ðŸ˜œ). For big companies, each team/division is a micro-community.

    Each company is different. Do your homework!

- If you join a community, it's delusional to expect running the house assuming that everyone listen at you, do what you say, etc.

    If you think so, your ego is of the size of God, aka authoritarian leadership.
