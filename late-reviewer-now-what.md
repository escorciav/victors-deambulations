# Late reviewer üò±, now what?

> Communication is crucial. Then, get the job done!

Let me tell you my experience reviewing for [CVPR 2022](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/) on a self-inflicted emergency.
Before, it's fair to disclose a bit of myself to avoid rookies clogging the system.
I have served as a reviewer in computer vision since 2016, illegally 2012, under the wing of my advisors.
I started submitting papers in 2012.
I got a handful of CVPR outstanding reviewer awards, yada yada. Enough showboating, let's serve the meat :meat:!

## 1. Why are you late?

I wonder what ACs hear. My guess is
Personal issues (e.g., travel disruption); 2. A real emergency (e.g., you got COVID19); 2. Bad planning; 4. let shine our emergency reviewers peers, etc. I recite them in the order gotten from [a Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/3scorciav/status/1484428856035627010).

At this point, it does not matter; what matters the most is to let the AC know.

## 2. What should I tell the AC?

The truth. But, pal! **less is more**. ACs don't work in a call-center providing personal support. Just tell them, "I'm sorry for being late. I have X issue."

_That's all? Did you get outstanding reviewers awards by quitting like that?_

Easy pal! The most important bit is to tell the ACS if you can complete the assignment or not soon. For example, the message sent to two ACs right after the reviewing duty ended was something like:

```
Don't worry, I have read the paper and collected many notes. I will complete the assignment.

There is no need to call an emergency reviewer for my spot.
```

_C'mmon, you were late writing the review. What about the more extreme situation (have not read the technical/experimental details)?"_

In that scenario, you tell the AC something as follows, **BUT, keep reading!** there are different ways to drop the ball üéæüèàüèÄ‚öΩ.

```
Genuinely sorry for failing you and the community. I feel incapable of completing the assignment correctly.

Please appoint an emergency reviewer for my spot, such that you and the authors get proper feedback.
```

## 3. Quitting like a pro

Let me bring you back to reality. If the ACs deem you relevant, they may not let you quit. However, there are ways to ease the burden of the reviewing duty for you. Moreover, your reputation is on stake. Don't just drop the ball and run away, if you can do more.

## 3.1 Leverage your network, part 1

In academia, we are not instructed to raise our hands. Instead, people who work as part of a real team know that asking for help is not a sign of weakness.

TLDR; the concrete step is _asking individually (unless you are PI or manager) among your peers if they can give you a hand._

The moment that it was evident that:
- The deadline has passed.
- It's unlikely to finish two assignments more appropriately.
- I have duties to complete on my 8 hours job Monday-Friday.

I just started messaging friends and collaborators in slack üòä.
Hopefully, *" a man trash is another man's treasure."*
CVPR didn't call my youngest collaborator as a reviewer. Thus, he was excited to serve the community.
That's the beauty of academic duties and mentorship to give us those flashbacks.
