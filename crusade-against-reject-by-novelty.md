# A crusade against rejected by novelty

Tips to get rid of the subjective label "your work lacks novelty. It's under the bar of the conference/journal".

> Sorry to hear that. Out there, there is a frustrated ðŸ¤“ troll with a keyboard as solely weapon.

1. As an author receiving it,

    2. Use something along [these lines](https://twitter.com/ArashVahdat/status/1433877678541574145?s=20).

    2. Politely squeeze it such that they spit that [their judgment is based on a subjective perception](https://twitter.com/ozansener/status/1434175858676322305).

3. When you are a reviewer, do your duty and obey the golden rule.

    1. Spit out why it's not novel. How? [This is](https://twitter.com/CSProfKGD/status/1433872171441479684?s=20) what a reasonable AC/editor wants to read.

    1. Don't collude with others. Challenge anyone claiming "not novel" during the discussion phase. You have a keyboard as well, let's collude against cyberbullying!

    1. Be reasonable. If you are tough in CVPR, be flexible in ECCV/ICCV if there are significant revisions.

4. As a conference organizer or editor in chief,

    1. Be on top of your ACs/Editors.

    2. Do a raffle and accept p% of papers rejected by novelty. Let's study the impact in 10 years.

    1. Hold your reviewers and AC/Editors accountable. Let's upgrade our peer-review system!

       1. What about if ACs/Editors and reviewers own p% of the citations of the publications that they accept?
          Likewise, they won't own shares on rejected publications. Let's discuss what will happen. But, in another post ðŸ™‚
