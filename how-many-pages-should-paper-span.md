# How many pages should a (ML/CV) paper have?

This week, the ever thirsty machine learning / computer vision (ML/ CV) community "find & make trendy" a [submission under reviewed for ICLR'22](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=TVHS5Y4dNvM).

The format of the papers spanned an opinionated discussion in social media and at least one Slack channel. About the question:

## How many pages?

### less is more, but ...

We already know that. Haven't you seen PI of large groups presenting two papers in 5 minutes or less?

However, a sharp reader might have anticipated that the scope of a talk is way different from peer-review.
IMHO, during peer-review, we scrutinize if an idea: (1) comply with the scientific method and (2) expand the body of knowledge further.

### so, give me a number!

I'm sorry to disappoint you; I don't have a concrete number.
Indeed, I do not care about the number of pages subject to:
a. the paper is clear and well-written.
b. I can assess it (easy to traverse and find relevant experiments)
c. I can fit it on my schedule.

Note that constraints a & b are under your control. Some tips and checklists to have in mind:
   
- Use straightforward English.

- Avoid bullshiting. Namely, when throwing conjectures use the right verbs: "suspect", "hyphotesize", "presume", "believe", etc. Instead of factual verbs: "show", "evidence".

- Organize your paper such that we tell a story instead of describing our likely non-linear and chaotic research journey.

  The organizational part and the fact that digital media (PDF) evolves make any concrete number of pages just a guesstimate. TBH, 4-8 are good enough up to single or double-column format.

## Do I genuinely buy that a paper didn't need eight pages?

It depends on what you want.

The work that people are talking about is a cute piece of experimental research with sarcastic tones. At least that's my take when you put the emoji in figure 1.

I do know that some companies see publications as the lowest-tier for their business growth. For people working there, writing less than 8-pages is a blessing. Is it also a blessing for the game between authors, reviewers & judges?

### What about the impact?

Jumping to "some ideas are as simple that few pages are enough, as one can see their impact" is another cup of tea.
Rating something as "impactful" sounds as subjective as "is/not novelty." I wrote about the latter [here](https://github.com/escorciav/victors-deambulations/blob/main/crusade-against-reject-by-novelty.md).

My questions to those claiming to be excellent and gauging impact are:

- Isn't it impact something that we measure in the future?
 
- If so, accepting a paper as I deem it valuable in the future, then shouldn't the community assess my decision in the future?

For those who like gambling or believe themselves good gamblers, shall we run a stress test?

How? read my entry about [novelty](https://github.com/escorciav/victors-deambulations/blob/main/crusade-against-reject-by-novelty.md).
I left an idea there for our peer-review system, fractional authorship/contribution ðŸ˜œ.
