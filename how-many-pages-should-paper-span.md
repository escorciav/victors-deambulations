# How many pages should a (ML/CV) paper have?

This week, the ever thirsty machine learning / computer vision (ML/ CV) community "find & make trendy" a [submission under reviewed for ICLR'22](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=TVHS5Y4dNvM).

The format of the papers spanned an opinionated discussion in social media and at least one Slack channel. About the question:

## How many pages?

### less is more, but ...

We already know that. Have you seen a senior researcher (Professor) presenting two papers in 5 minutes or less?

However, a sharp reader might have anticipated that the scope of a talk is way different from peer-review.
IMHO, during peer-review we scrutinize if an idea: (1) comply with the scientific method and (2) expand the body of knowledge further.
Thus, enough rigurosity in the presentation is needed to fullfil the two objectives.

### so, give me a number!

I'm sorry to disappoint you; I don't have a concrete number.
Indeed, I do not care about the number of pages as long as:

1. the paper is clear and well-written.

2. I can assess it. Namely, (i) it's easy to traverse, (ii) it's technically sound, (iii) find relevant experiments, and (iv) present appropriate comparisons).

3. I can fit it on my schedule.

Note that the first two constraints are under the author's control. Some tips and checklists that tell about the quality of the presentation are:
   
- Use straightforward English.

- Avoid bullshiting. Namely, when throwing conjectures use the right verbs: "suspect", "hyphotesize", "presume", "believe", etc. Instead of factual verbs: "show", "evidence".

- Organize your paper such that we tell a story instead of describing our likely non-linear and chaotic research journey.

  The organizational part and the fact that digital media (PDF) evolves make any concrete number of pages just a guesstimate. TBH, 4-8 are good enough up to single or double-column format.

## Do I genuinely buy that a paper didn't need eight pages?

It depends on what you want.

I won't comment about the paper under-review. Other than saying that it's a cute piece of experimental research with sarcastic tones (title, figure 1, etc).

 I do know that some companies see publications as the lowest-tier for their business growth. For people working there, writing less than 8-pages is a blessing. Is it also a blessing for the game between authors, reviewers & judges?

### On impact, and another concern of people with the paper

- Isn't it disrecpectful to present an idea onto a "top-tier venue" without the maximum number of pages?

   First, deciding what's disrecpectful is up to the judges. If the tips about presentation were followed, authors are just being creative in the presentation of their work.
 
   Similarly, venues become "top-tier" due to impact, not to number of pages. Thus, short papers is OK in principle.

-  Short presentation might correspond to simple ideas. Thus, those are the impactful ones.

   In other words, "More papers like this are needed. Some ideas are simple that few pages are enough. As long as the judges feel that it's impactful is OK."
   
   The quote above is another cup of tea. Rating something as "impactful" sounds as subjective as "is/not novelty." I wrote about the latter [here](https://github.com/escorciav/victors-deambulations/blob/main/crusade-against-reject-by-novelty.md).

   My questions to those claiming to be excellent and gauging impact are:

   - Isn't it impact something that we measure in the future?
 
   - If so, accepting a paper as I deem it valuable in the future, then shouldn't the community assess my decision in the future?

   For those who like gambling or believe themselves good gamblers, shall we run a stress test?

   How? read my entry about [novelty](https://github.com/escorciav/victors-deambulations/blob/main/crusade-against-reject-by-novelty.md).
   I left an idea there for our peer-review system, fractional authorship/contribution ðŸ˜œ.
