# [How To Write A Computer Vision Paper?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p-uYv0JPZB1Wqf9AKQdL6WXId4jDW6fCOoNOhHv-aZg/edit?userstoinvite=yasser.benigmim@gmail.com&sharingaction=manageaccess&role=writer#slide=id.p)

You can find the talk [**here**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p-uYv0JPZB1Wqf9AKQdL6WXId4jDW6fCOoNOhHv-aZg/edit?userstoinvite=yasser.benigmim@gmail.com&sharingaction=manageaccess&role=writer#slide=id.p)

It was a fun experience preparing for the talk with Fabian.
As usual, working with Fabian is fun.
Now, it was a blast given that:
- I've been hesitant about such commitments since 2020.
  Having someone who contributes to the development process eases things.
- Working with Fabian felt like working with Bryan Russell, back in 2019.
  Laser focus on reducing unclarity.
  Nice way to convey & receive thoughts.
- We could talk about experiences & things typical of ðŸ¤“'s pub conversations.
- Friends connection.
  One meeting was 90% catching up about prof kinda discouraging things ðŸ¥°.
  Sharing struggles to let it go.

Do you gotta prepare a follow-up or complementary talk?
Lemme walk you through our mindset.

- Fabian and I adapted [Bill Freeman's talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p-uYv0JPZB1Wqf9AKQdL6WXId4jDW6fCOoNOhHv-aZg/edit?userstoinvite=yasser.benigmim@gmail.com&sharingaction=manageaccess&role=writer#slide=id.g26c6432dd24_0_22) for a Latino audience with undergrad.

- Unfortunately, we didn't get tips or experiences from the Colombian visual perception godfathers: [JC's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hqNhUCYAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Pablo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0nZO90AAAAJ&hl=en).

  Victor did find out [two pertinent contributions from Domingo Mery](https://domingomery.ing.puc.cl/presentations/).
Links added in our talk ðŸ˜‰.

- We only put together the must things.
  But, other talks from the _"Citizen's of computer vision community [2018-morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKUCz_3Ee0A), [2018-aftenoon](https://youtu.be/imEtTnQKt4M)."_ feel pertinent & relevant to adapt.

That's all folks!
