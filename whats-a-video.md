# What's a video?

For those who don't know me my graduate studies (MSc 🇨🇴 & Phd 🇸🇦) centered around **video** understanding.
After discussing with young lads, I figured it out that there might not be a encompassing defition of video.
Thus,

_⁉️ why not writing about it?_

WIP

Around the middle part of my PhD, I got to know about the Pythonic scientific kit (scikit) toolset for dealing with videos, [scikit-videos](http://www.scikit-video.org/stable/).

I was still inmature, and disregarded it as I found it slow and just a nice wrapper around my go to [FFMpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
The latter is perhaps the most popular video processing tool of the world.

_🙋🏽‍♂️ Why did I put my eyes on sci-kit video?_

Perhaps, I was interested on using motion vectors to speed up conv-nets.
Unfortunatly, I could not retrieve a cool tutorial about video compression that I read back in ~2017.
But, I found [the FFGligtch](https://ffglitch.org/) which looks cool to watch after harvesting season 🍄.

_🙋🏽‍♂️ Haven't I taught anything yet?_

My bad 😞, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Lemme depart with some dots that I connected but I haven't confirmed.
[PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) is a Pythonic wrapper for the AV decoding library.
Think about AV as the audio-visual layer behind FFmpeg.
If you are a (genuine) computer vision scientist (de los de la mata 🇪🇸), [libjpeg](https://libjpeg.sourceforge.net/) ↔️ [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) as AV ↔️ FFmpeg 🤓😉.
The analogy isn't perfect, but the bottomline is: _FFmpeg packs a heck of stuff to process any kind of video._
Check out [AV](https://github.com/libav/libav) itself, it has a myriad of things.
