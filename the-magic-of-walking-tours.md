# Exploring New Cities: The Magic of Walking Tours

Visiting a new city is always an exciting adventure.
The prospect of discovering hidden gems, local traditions, and fascinating history can make for a memorable experience.
After years traveling over multiple cities, my go to way to immerse in a new city is through walking tours.
These guided journeys take you through the heart of a place, revealing its soul one step at a time.
Let me share some of my unforgettable experiences in London, Rome, Oxford/Cambridge.

## London & Rome

Historical cities abundant of architecture that sometimes speaks by themselves should be visited with a guide.
_Isn't getting a guided service expensive?_
In remarkable touristic destinations, there is a cheap way: __*free* walking tours__.
In Rome, I strolled through the ancient wonders, guided by an enthusiastic historian student who transported me back to the glory of the Roman Empire.
In London, I embarked on a journey through the historic heart of the city, passing iconic landmarks like Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.
What made these tours even more special was that I experienced them in Spanish 🇪🇸, a nod to my mother who was visiting and appreciated the familiarity of her native language.
These tours not only enriched our understanding of the cities but also created cherished memories of exploring new places together.
For my latino friends, free means **tip based** (⚠️ do NOT what you'd pay in your country ‼️).
> 🙏🏼 Please pay a fair amount on _free walking tours._

## Oxford & Cambridge

In Oxford, I discovered the best delivery of a walking tour.
While guided tours are widely available, I was fortunate to have a friend living in the city.
His personalized tour revealed hidden courtyards, secret gardens, and lesser-known historical facts.
It was a unique and intimate experience, making me appreciate the city on a whole new level.
Thus, explore it with a local if you have the chance. Much preferably, a local friend.
Unfortunatly, there are **NO** free walking tours in Italian in Cambridge 🇮🇹.
If you don't mind my broken Italian, I'm happy to try.
I'm glad that Giada compiled a some notes in Italian for our usual tour [here 📝](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VxKrLTY5XR6xRYXXPA_OUcCfxmCEBmUy/view?usp=sharing).

Now, here's a handy tip for making the most of your walking tours: consider using the [GPSmyCity app](https://www.gpsmycity.com/).
It offers a wide range of self-guided walking tours, complete with maps and detailed descriptions.
**I've only used the free tier.**

Walking tours provide a deeper connection to the places you visit and the stories they hold. They allow you to see the world through the eyes of locals and knowledgeable guides, ensuring that your travel experiences are not just memorable but truly transformative.
