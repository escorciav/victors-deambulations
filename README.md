# Victor's deambulations (Blog)

Pseudo-random deambulations.

- First are foremost, thanks for even reading this or any of the posts. Reactions in the forms of Github's ⭐ or sharing in social media are highly appreciated 🥰.

- Comments and discussions are welcome on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook. I might re-route it based on the exchange.

- For formality reasons*, opinions disclosed here might be highly subjective and mine. They could be not aligned to the values or thoughts of my employer/organization/institution, client, colleague, or friend.

  Not I deem that the formality above is needed, but not all people are the same. In mundane words, "it takes all sorts to make a world."

## TODO

- Write!

- Add a Jekyll blog theme
