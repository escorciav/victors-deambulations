# Cambridge tips & recommendations 🇬🇧

After 3 years living in Cambridge 🇬🇧, I've been asked a few times for tips on what to do in the city.
I've decided to write them down here so I can share them with more people.

## Short visit

If you are visiting Cambridge for a short period of time (1 day), I would recommend you to do the following:

1. Classic Free Tour, book it online 🆓🚶:information_source:.
I've done it in English & Spanish, like more the latter.

2. Punting, with your own booze 🥂, to cover the bridges and views of Colleges 🏛️🌉.
Highly recommended if it's a sunny day spring-autum day (i.e., not winter) 🌤️⛅.

3. In a rainy day, the Gin experience or the Fitzwilliam museum maybe 🤔
I haven't done it but I've heard good things about them.

4. I usually meet & greet visitors in a tourist attraction of the city, [The Eagle ~~TODO:link~~](https://goo.gl/maps/6Z6Z1Z6Z6Z6Z6Z6Z6) pub 🍻.
I like to tell them why it's popular there.
Thus, please don't google or read reviews if you are coming with me 😅.

## More time, a second visit or a local?

### Walking

Not cloudy day?

- A walk in [GranChester Meadows ~~TODO: Google Maps 🗺️~~](https://goo.gl/maps/6Z6Z1Z6Z6Z6Z6Z6Z6) ending in the [Orchard tea Garden](https://www.theorchardteagarden.co.uk/) 👌🏼.
I'm a nerd so that tea place is in my top despite the food is OK 😅.

- In case GranChester push u far from the action, a walk along the Cam river from Pickerel pub to Midsummer commons is decent for tourist.

- [Onto Pub Crawling?](https://cutwc.org/Social/PubCrawls/)
1st The Pickerel - The Anchor - Regal

### Cambridge Colleges

➡️ Any friends with Cambridge uni affiliation?
Ask them to take you to their college.
Even better if you get invited to a formal dinner 🍽️🕴️.

### Food

- The best coffee experience of the city is with [Dom](https://goo.gl/maps/TYxMFV3jo8MjG3tMA).
Chill vibe to disconnect yourself.
Bringing cash with you is a MUST.

- So far the best Sunday Roast I've had in Cambridge is [Petersfield ~~TODO: link~~](https://goo.gl/maps/6Z6Z1Z6Z6Z6Z6Z6Z6).

- Steakhouse?
[La Maison du Steak](https://goo.gl/maps/D4DR6NE72xf4dTUv9) is my favourite so far.
