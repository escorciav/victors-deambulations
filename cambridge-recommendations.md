# Cambridge tips & recommendations 🇬🇧

After 3 years living in Cambridge 🇬🇧, I've been asked a few times for tips on what to do in the city.
I've decided to write them down here so I can share them with more people.

## Short visit

If you are visiting Cambridge for a short period of time (1 day), I would recommend you to do the following:

1. Classic Free Tour, book it online 🆓🚶:information_source:.
I've done it in English & Spanish, like more the latter.

2. Punting, with your own booze 🥂, to cover the bridges and views of Colleges 🏛️🌉.
Highly recommended if it's a sunny day spring-autum day (i.e., not winter) 🌤️⛅.

3. In a rainy day, the Gin experience or the Fitzwilliam museum maybe 🤔
I haven't done it but I've heard good things about them.

4. I usually meet & greet visitors in a tourist attraction of the city, [The Eagle](https://goo.gl/maps/HYZABqmz7LwdP9xo8) pub 🍻.
I like to tell them why it's popular there.
Thus, please don't google or read reviews if you are coming with me 😅.

## More time, a second visit or a local?

### Walking

Not cloudy day?

- A walk in [Grantchester Meadows](https://goo.gl/maps/epC6ioeKivhYNoADA) ending in the [Orchard tea Garden](https://www.theorchardteagarden.co.uk/) 👌🏼.
I'm a nerd so that tea place is in my top despite the food is OK 😅.

- In case GranChester push u far from the action, a walk along the Cam river from Pickerel pub to Midsummer commons is decent for tourist.
    In case, along that way go all the way to Fenn Ditton.
    Finishing your route on [The Plough](https://goo.gl/maps/Fr49zvQ7meib9zRk6) with pint 🍻💖.

- [Onto Pub Crawling?](https://cutwc.org/Social/PubCrawls/)
1st The Pickerel - The Anchor - Regal.
A good friend of mine loves [Cambridge Blue ~~TODO:link-missing~~]().
Go there for beer variety, but in 2022 & 2023 food was not great.

### Cambridge Colleges

➡️ Any friends with Cambridge uni affiliation?
Ask them to take you to their college.
Even better if you get invited to a formal dinner 🍽️🕴️.

### Food

- The best coffee experience of the city is with [Dom](https://goo.gl/maps/TYxMFV3jo8MjG3tMA).
Chill vibe to disconnect yourself.
Bringing cash with you is a MUST.

- So far the best Sunday Roast I've had in Cambridge is [Petersfield](https://goo.gl/maps/DnNrVdjuJ54s2mFdA).

- [Fort St George](https://goo.gl/maps/yru3pQtmPdiE8ZXH9) is a good option for beef pie 🍖🥧.
[The Alma](https://goo.gl/maps/i8KMQG9fD9h8rfX27) serves meaty pie 😉.

- Steakhouse?
[La Maison du Steak](https://goo.gl/maps/D4DR6NE72xf4dTUv9) is my favourite so far.
