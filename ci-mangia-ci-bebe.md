# üáÆüáπ Si Mangia e Si Bebe Benne

I regard myself as a foodie.
Not as a hobbist who chase restaurants/bars/etc.
Rather as someone who was taught to eat everything, YET develop a good palate.

As I've spent a cosiderable amount of time in Veneto with locals.
I have a list of places to visit if you happen to be in the area.

## Brioche e cafe ü•ê‚òï

An typical italian person might just have a espresso for breakfast.
But, that's not enough for me (& many more, innit?) üòÖ.
Here it's my go to list:

> ‚ù£Ô∏è Brioche in Veneto/Italy is a croissant typically filled in, but you can get it empty as well.
  
1. [Pasticceria Chantilly, Gorgo Al Montincano.](https://www.instagram.com/past.chantilly/?hl=en)
  Go to if you wanna block you veins with cream, ciocollateo, pistaccio cream ... you got it üòâ

2. [Pasticceria Forner, Oderzo.](https://www.instagram.com/pasticceria.forner/?hl=en)
  The best in Oderzo IMO, and few steps away from the city center.

3. TODO:link, Ceggia.
  I perfer their Kraffen over the brioche here.

4. [Torrefazione Caffe Franco, Oderzo.](https://restaurantguru.it/Torrefazione-Caffe-Franco-Oderzo)
  Looking for a nice place to meet a friend, go here.
  Nice day? Make your way to the garden area.
